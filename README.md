# Sketch Artboard Notes - Add notes to your artboards

Artboard Notes adds a text area to the inspector, for use however you like. It is simple, lighweight and native and feels great within the Sketch UI. Simply select an artboard and the text area will be available.

The share menu includes a custom `Copy` action that copies text to the clipboard, as well as the other system share extensions.
